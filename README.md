Cockroach poker (icelandic)

# Rules:
The deck is made up of 64 cards with 8 different types and 8 of each card (8x8). Each player has two "decks", one on their hand which they hide and one pile. The player loses if their pile contains four of the same card or one of each card.

The deck is diveded randomly and as equally as possible among all players.

The game is about bluffing, a player starts each round by handing a card of their choice to another player and announcing what that card is while not showing anyone the card. The recipient then has two choices:
1. Call the bluff. In this case the recipient decides whether the hidden card is what the card-gives says or if they're lying. If the recipient is correct, then the card-gives gets the card and places it in their pile (not their hand), visible to all other players.
2. Give the card to another player. This is only possible if the recipient is not the last person receiving the card. They then look at the card (not showing anyone else) and pass it to another player and tell them which card it is, which they can lie about.
